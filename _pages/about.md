# About

Hello there! You've reached my personal page!

I'm Nicola, a physicist currently working on the study, detection and control of molecular chirality using structured light fields and non-Hermitian physics.

I'm a MSCA Research Fellow at the [AttoKings](www.attokings.com) group at King's College London. 

Before joining the group, I was a PostDoc in the Theory Department of the [Max-Born-Institut](https://www.mbi-berlin.de) (MBI) in Berlin, where I worked with Prof. Olga Smirnova on topological synthetic chiral fields.

In 2023, I obtained my PhD from [Humboldt University](https://www.hu-berlin.de) (HU-Berlin), after working for few years as a Graduate Researcher at the MBI under the supervision of Prof. Misha Ivanov. My PhD thesis was on the control and spectroscopy of quantum dynamics using tailored multicolor laser fields.

I did my M.Sc. in Optical Sciences at HU-Berlin, where I graduated in 2017 with a thesis on complex autoionization resonances and the phenomenon of interference stabilization.

I completed in 2015 my B.Sc. in Physics at the [University of Trieste](https://portale.units.it/it), where I moved from my hometown of Pordenone in north-east Italy in 2011.
