# About

Hello there! I'm Nicola, a physicist currently working in the [Attosecond Quantum Physics Group](https://www.attokings.com/) at King's College London.

My current research is on the ultrafast detection and control of chirality using structured light fields and dissipative structures.

Before joining the group as a Research Fellow, I've worked for many years in the Theory Department at the [Max-Born-Institut](https://www.mbi-berlin.de/) in Berlin as a PhD student first and PostDoc later on. 

I've completed my M.Sc. studies in Optical Sciences at HU-Berlin and my B.Sc. in Physics at the University of Trieste, in Italy.

I'm originally from Pordenone, a small town in north-east Italy.
